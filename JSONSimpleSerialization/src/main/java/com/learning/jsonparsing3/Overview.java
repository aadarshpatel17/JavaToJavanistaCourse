     * Serialization in Java: Using JSON in Java for Serialization & Parsing
     *  -   The javascript object notation or JSON format is a popular and widely used data format
     *      for serializing the internal state of objects to a format that is both structured and
     *      human-readable
     *  -   The JSON in Java Library, also referred to as the org.json library offers powerful features
     *      and constructs for serialization of Java objects, to JSON and for parsing JSON Files and
     *      structures
     *
     * In this course, you will:
     *  -   Use the JSON Java library to serialize data to the JSON format and parse JSON data to
     *      extract information
     *  -   See that the JSON and Java library offers more powerful functionality to work with JSON
     *      as compared to JSON simple library that we had explored earlier
     *  -   JSON in Java, allows for pretty printing of JSON objects and allows us to access the value
     *      in JSON fields without having to cast those values to the right  type
     *  -   Explore the use of different methods to create JSON arrays specifically the put accumulate
     *      and append methods
     *  -   Learn the nuances of working with each of these methods and how they differ from one another
     *  -   Seeing how easy the org.json library makes it to serialize custom objects to the JSON format
     *  -   Library makes use of reflection to determine what internal state of an object should be
     *      persisted
     *  -   Have the skills and ability to use the powerful features of the JSON and Java library to
     *      perform JSON parsing
