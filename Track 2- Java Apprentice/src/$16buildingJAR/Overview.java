     * Java Archive (JAR): Building Java Archive
     *  -   While coding is what often takes up most of your time and energy while developing an app, the final step
     *      before using it involves packaging it into a form which can be easily deployed and distributed.
     *  -   This is what we explore in this path. This course looks into building Java archive or JAR files using
     *      the jar utility which can be run from the command line.
     *
     *  -   Kick off this course by creating a simple Java project with main class and packaging it into a jar file
     *      which can be executed directly.
     *  -   Move on to the detailed look at the jar manifest file and learn of the different attributes which this can
     *      include and how it can affect the way in which jar file is used
     *  -   Build a project with external dependencies and cover how such a project can be packaged into an executable
     *      jar.
     *  -   Then get to build different types of Java archive, including one with multiple main classes, one containing
     *      a number of java packages, and will also create an archive which is not directly executed by itself, but
     *      rather can be used as dependencies in other projects
     *  -   Know how to create basic jar files, including executables jars using jar utility
     *  -   Build such archives for your own applications or explore more advanced topics where you can build jar files
     *      with their dependencies packaged within
