    /**
     * In this course, you will:
     *  -   Begin with an in-depth exploration of the use of annotations and how they work with Reflection
     *  -   Learn both built-in and custom annotations and see how annotations on an object or a method can
     *      be picked up using Reflection
     *  -   Learn that not all annotations can be picked up by Reflection and this in turn leads us to the
     *      idea of the retention policy of an annotation
     *  -   Observe only annotations with the retention policy of runtime can be accessed via reflection
     *  -   Explore Generics, see how much type information and information about type parameters in
     *      generics classes is lost by runtime as so is not accessible via Reflection
     *  -   Explore using Arrays with Reflection. Learn to work with different primitive as well as
     *      referral types and also how to access their corresponding runtime class objects
     *  -   Create new arrays by invoking the .newInstance() method and view and edit the values in the
     *      arrays using Get and Set methods
     *  -   Grip on the foundation of Reflection in Java and will be ready to explore the immense power
     *      of Reflection combined with dynamic proxies and invocation handler
