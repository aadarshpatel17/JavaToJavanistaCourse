/**
     * Lambda Expressions
     *  -   Lambda expressions allows you to define classes that implement single method interfaces in a very
     *      concise and compact manner. This makes code that uses lambda functions easier to read and
     *      understand and much more maintainable.
     *  -   Lambda expressions can be made even more compact and readable by the use of Method references.
     *
     * In this course, you will:
     *  -   Learn to create and use lambda expressions to implement functional interfaces
     *  -   See that lambda expressions are essentially blocks of code that accept inputs
     *      arguments, perform operations and return values
     *  -   See that lambda can only be used to implement functional interfaces that is,
     *      interfaces that have exactly one abstract method
     *  -   Understand and implement the four types and categories of functional interfaces,
     *      the Predicate, the Function, the Consumer, and the Supplier interface
     *
     * Finally, you will:
     *  -   Round this course off by exploring and implementing method references, which are essentially
     *      even more compact representations of Lambda expressions
     *
