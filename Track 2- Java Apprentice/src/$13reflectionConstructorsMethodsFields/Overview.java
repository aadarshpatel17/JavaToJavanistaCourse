public class Overview {

    /**
     * In this course, you will:
     *  -   Extract information and metadata about the constructors in a class
     *  -   See how the .getConstructors() methods only return public constructors, in order
     *      to access private or protected constructors we've got to make use of the
     *      .getDeclaredConstructor() method
     *  -   Explore metadata about the fields using Reflection. As we learn, the term field
     *      can be used to refer to member variables in a class and this includes static
     *      as well as instance variables
     *  -   Begin by obtaining Java objects as represent fields and then view information about
     *      those fields such as their types, values, and modifiers
     *  -   Conclude the course with the discussion of using reflection with methods
     *  -   Access all the methods in a class by invoking .get() methods method on the class
     *      object, and you note that all methods from the base class are also included in the
     *      return value from this method invocation
     *  -   Learn how to use reflection in order to access parameter and return types of a method
     *  -   Note that some but not all annotations that have been applied to a method can also be
     *      picked up using reflection. Whether an annotation can be accessed via reflection depends
     *      on the retention policy of that annotation
