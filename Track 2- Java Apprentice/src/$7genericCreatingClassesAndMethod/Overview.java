     *      or a method to operate on objects fo various types while providing compile
     *      time safety. Generics allows for code reuse with different types of data.
     *  -   This greatly increases the maintainability of your code, generics also
     *      convert runtime checks to compiles time checks, thus making your code less
     *      error-prone.
