     *      The Java Collections Framework is a set of classes and interfaces
     *      that implement commonly reusable collection data structures.
     *      The Collections framework provides interfaces that define various
     *      collections and classes that implement them.

     *      Arrays do not part of the Java Collection framework are also
     *      structures that allow you to store multiple elements. Arrays
     *      are incredibly useful, though they have significant drawbacks
     *      when used as collection containers.
