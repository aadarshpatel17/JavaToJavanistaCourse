     * Lists & List Operations -
     *  -   The most widely used collection structure is the list. The list stores data
     *      in an ordered sequence, and the list allows you to store duplicate values.
     *      The Java collections Framework provides a number of different list
     *      implementations.
     *  -   However, of these, the arraylist is the most commonly used. If you are
     *      writing Java code and need a container to store elements.
     *  -   A list is probably what you will use unless you require the special properties
     *      of the other types of collection.
