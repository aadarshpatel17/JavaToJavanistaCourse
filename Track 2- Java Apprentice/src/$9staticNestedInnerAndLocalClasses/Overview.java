	/**
	 * Classes In Java Working With Static Nested Inner And Local Classes
	 * 	-	Learn to create and use static nested classes defined within an outer class.
	 * 	-	See how a closer relationship can be expressed with the outer class, when you
	 * 		define inner classes, inner classes can only be instantiated with reference to 
	 * 		an object of the outer class
	 * 	-	Define and use local classes which are created within a code block
	 * 	-	Learn that access modifiers do not apply to local classes as local
	 * 		classes are only visible within the block of code where they are defined
