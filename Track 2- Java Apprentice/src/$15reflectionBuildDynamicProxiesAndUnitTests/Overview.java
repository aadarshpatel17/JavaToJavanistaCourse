    /**
     * Reflection:
     *  -   Reflection is a popular programming technique that accesses and modifiers class
     *      and object information at runtime. Reflection is available in many programming
     *      languages, but Java has an especially powerful set of reflection APIs which reflect
     *      no pun intended. The emphasis that Java lies on type safety. Reflection in Java is
     *      built on the idea that every class, interface, method, or field is itself
     *      represented by an object.
     *
     *  -   For instance, all classes are represented by instances of the built-in class
     *      java.lang.class. In addition to all the foundations aspects of the reflection
     *      APIs we discuss advances topics such as dynamic proxies and invocation handlers,
     *      as well as total combination of reflection and annotations.
