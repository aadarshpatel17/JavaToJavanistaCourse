    /**
     * Java: Getting Started with Reflection
     *  In this course:
     *  -   Learn how to access a Java object that represents a class of java object.
     *      This idea take some getting used to, but it's the foundation of Reflection
     *      because every Java class is itself represented by an object of java.lang.Class
     *  -   Move on to the use of Reflection APIs to view the fields, constructors, and
     *      methods in a class. Create objects of a variety of built-in classes and use
     *      Reflection to view the class of an object.
     *  -   Discuss the significance of the fully qualified name of the class and see how
     *      this fully qualified name can be use along with static.forName() method from
     *      java.lang.Class in order to get a class object for any class by just passing
     *      in that fully qualified name.
     *  -   Move on members and objects of classes and to using Reflection to access modifiers
     *      applied to the member variables and member functions of an object.
