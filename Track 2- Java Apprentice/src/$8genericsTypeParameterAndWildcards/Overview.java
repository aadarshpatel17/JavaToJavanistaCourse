     * Generic in Java: Bounded Type Parameters & Wildcards
     *
     *  -   Unbounded types in generics have no constraints. Any type of objects can be
     *      specified as type arguments. If your type parameter is an unbounded type
     *      with bounded type parameter, you can specify constraints on the type argu-
     *      -ments and indicates that you want the types to derive from a c certain
     *      base class or implement a certain interface.
     *  -   The wild card in Java is a special kind of type argument that controls the
     *      type safety of the use of generic types, unbounded upper-bounded adn lower-
     *      bounded wildcards allow you to control what kind of type should be used
     *      with a generic method.
