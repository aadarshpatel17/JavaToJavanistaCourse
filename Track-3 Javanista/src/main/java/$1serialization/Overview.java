     * Serialization in Java: Getting Started with Object Serialization
     *  -   Serialization in Java allows us to convert the internal state of an object to a byte stream.
     *      Serialization allows us to save the state of Java objects out of files or send objects over a
     *      network connection. Deserialization then allows to recreate the original object from the byte
     *      stream thus enabling data transfer.
     *
     * In this course:
     *  -   See how we can define classes in Java that are serializable, that is, classes whose objects
     *      can be converted to a byte stream.
     *  -   See that this simply requires the use of the serializable marker interface that contains no
     *      methods that need to be implemented.
     *  -   See how you convert serializable class definitions using the serial version UID Field and learn
     *      how versioning should be used for backward compatible and backward incompatible changes.
     *  -   Learn the use of the transient modifier to Mark State that should not be serialized and the
     *      conditions under which Java will serialize objects with nested reference.
     *
     * Finally, you will:
     *  -   Round this course off by exploring the externalizable interface, which offers a very find-grained
     *      control over what internal state you want to serialize.
