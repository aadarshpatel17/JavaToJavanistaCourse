     * HTTP Requests with Java:
     *  -   One of the standard techniques for communication between applications is an HTTP request. This allows
     *      client applications to submit requests to server apps, which in turn can process the request and send
     *      back a response to the client.
     *  -   The focus of this learning path is a developing the clients for such interactions using native libraries
     *      of the Java programming language. This course aims to introduce you to the different forms of HTTP
     *      requests and how these can be formulated and communicated in Java app using the HTTP URL connection
     *      class.
     *
     *  -   Begin by constructing a basic get request in order to retrieve data
     *  -   Cover the various details available in a response from the response code and headers to the body
     *      and will look into both HTML and JSON data in the body
     *  -   Cover the use of POST request to submit the data in order to create a resource at a server, a PUT
     *      request to update such a resource and a delete request to remove it
     *  -   Look into setting a timeout for requests which takes too long to process
     *  -   Have clear understanding of how the HTTP URL connection can be adopted in order to communicate with
     *      remote applications in a standardized manner
