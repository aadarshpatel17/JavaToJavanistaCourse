     * Serialization in Java: Using JSON Simple for Serialization & Parsing
     *  -   Understand the JSON format to represent data
     *  -   Learn how simple primitives, entities and arrays are represented in JSON and how you can use th eJSON simple
     *      library to create JSON objects and write to a JSON format and then read JSON files and parse the JSON
     *      Structure.
     *  -   Learn to use a SAX-based interface to parse JSON files
     *  -   SAX interface originally created for XML data allows you to read even very large JSON files where the entire
     *      file cannot be loaded into memory in one go.
     *  -   See how the JSON Simple Library allows you to serialize custom objects to JSON by having them implement
     *      the JSONAware or JSONStreamAware interfaces.
     *  -   Have the knowledge to work with JSON data.
     *  -   Serialize structures to the JSON format and parse JSON data to get Java objects.
